## Cassandra Setup

Since this project incorporates database integration, you must adhere to the following instructions before running the app.  
A `docker-compose.yml` file is included in this project which will be used for creating a Cassandra container. Some commands are also added to the `Makefile` file for running a container (The following guide is applicable if GNU/Make tool is installed on your machine).

### Run A Cassandra Container

First, make sure Docker is up and running on your machine. Then in the root path of the project run the following command:

```text
$ make cassandra-up
```

In order to stop the container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make cassandra-down
```

Although it stops the container, still the volume related to the previously-created container exits and if you run `make cassandra-up` again, you have access to persisted data if any.  
In order to stop the container and at the same time remove the volume related to that container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make cassandra-down-rm-vol
```

### Create A Keyspace

This is an important step while using the Cassandra database. In the context of Apache Cassandra, a keyspace is the top-level structure that holds data. It can be thought of as similar to a database in a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL. To do that, you can use the `cqlsh` utility to connect to Cassandra:

```text
$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> cqlsh
```

Then you need to run the following command to create a new keyspace:

```text
cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE test_keyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
```

If you decide to change `test_keyspace` to some other name, make sure to update the value of `cluster.Keyspace` inside `internal/adapters/repositories/cassandra/repository.go` file as well.  
To make sure the new keyspace is create successfully, you can run the following command:

```text
cqlsh> DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;

system       system_distributed  system_traces  system_virtual_schema
system_auth  system_schema       system_views   test_keyspace
```
