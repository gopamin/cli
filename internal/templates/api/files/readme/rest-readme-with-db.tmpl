## API Guide

By sending an HTTP GET request to the `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users` endpoint, you'll get a successful response which shows no data simply because no user is added to the database.

### Add A New User

In order to add a new user, run the following curl command in the terminal:

```text
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "John Doe"
}'
```

Now by sending an HTTP GET request to the `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users`, you'll see a user named John Doe in the response.
