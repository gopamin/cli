## MySQL Setup

This project comes with a `docker-compose.yml` file which will be used for creating a MySQL container. Also there is a `Makefile` which includes some commands for running a container (The following guide is applicable if GNU/Make tool is installed on your machine).

### How to Run A MySQL Container?

First, make sure Docker is up and running on your machine. Then in the root path of the project run the following command:

```text
$ make mysql-up
```

In order to stop the container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make mysql-down
```

Although it stops the container, still the volume related to the previously-created container exits and if you run `make mysql-up` again, you have access to persisted data if any.  
In order to stop the container and at the same time remove the volume related to that container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make mysql-down-rm-vol
```
