## DynamoDB Setup
Since this project incorporates database integration, you must adhere to the following instructions before running the app.  
A `docker-compose.yml` file is included in this project which will be used for creating a DynamoDB container. Some commands are also added to the `Makefile` file for running a container (The following guide is applicable if GNU/Make tool is installed on your machine).

### Run A DynamoDB Container

First, make sure Docker is up and running on your machine. Then in the root path of the project run the following command:

```text
$ make dynamodb-up
```
Upon initial execution of the application, a folder named `docker` will be generated at the project's root (This folder is ignored by Git by default).  
In order to stop the container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make dynamodb-down
```

Although it stops the container, still the `docker` folder related to the previously-created container exits and if you run `make dynamodb-up` again, you have access to persisted data if any.  
In order to stop the container and at the same time remove the local `docker` folder related to that container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make dynamodb-down-rm-vol
```
