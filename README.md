# Introduction

CLI tool for the Gopamin framework. Gopamin CLI create new project based on ideas promoted by [Standard Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) which is a well-accepted architecture by the Go community (It's not an official standard defined by the core Go dev team; however, it is a set of common historical and emerging project layout patterns in the Go ecosystem).

## Installation

To install Gopamin CLI, run the following command inside terminal:

```text
$ go install https://github.com/gopamin/cli
```

## Usage

In order to create a new Go boilerplate project, first make sure the Gopamin CLI is installed correctly in your `$GOPATH` by running the following command:

```text
$ gopamin --version
```

If you got the current version correctly, now you can create a new project by running the following command:

```text
$ gopamin create
```
