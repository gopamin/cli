## Redis Setup
Since this project incorporates database integration, you must adhere to the following instructions before running the app.  
A `docker-compose.yml` file is included in this project which will be used for creating a Redis container. Some commands are also added to the `Makefile` file for running a container (The following guide is applicable if GNU/Make tool is installed on your machine).

### Run A Redis Container

First, make sure Docker is up and running on your machine. Then in the root path of the project run the following command:

```text
$ make redis-up
```

In order to stop the container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make redis-down
```

Although it stops the container, still the volume related to the previously-created container exits and if you run `make redis-up` again, you have access to persisted data if any.  
In order to stop the container and at the same time remove the volume related to that container, you can run the following command:

```text
$ make redis-down-rm-vol
```
